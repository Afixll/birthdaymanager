# birthdaymanager
A simple program to help you manage birthdays

Currently implemented:

- -l: lists every birthday
- -n: lists every birthday within the next 30days
- -add NAME/DAY/MONTH/{YEAR}: adds a birthday with given name and date. Year is optional.
- -remove INDEX: remove a birthday with index INDEX

TO-DO:

- Add an option to change path of the .txt file storing the birthdays
- Make it possible to call the program directly from the GNU bash, eg. by typing "birthdaysmanager -options". Honestly have no idea how though
